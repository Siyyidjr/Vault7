/* Overview
Windows 7 includes a feature that enables approved applications running with Admin privileges to perform system operations without
the UAC prompt. One method an application can use to do this is to create an “Elevated COM Object” and use it to perform the operation. 
For example, a DLLloaded into explorer.exe can create an elevated IFileOperation object and use it to delete a file from the Windows
directory. This technique can be combined with process injection to produce a more direct UAC bypass.

The code sample below must be executed within the context of a process approved for elevation, otherwise it will trigger the UAC prompt.
Most Microsoft-signed executables that ship with Windows are approved, most usefully explorer.exe, as it is generally running,
but also others such as calc.exe or notepad.exe may be useful if executing in explorer’s process is alerting to a PSP. */
